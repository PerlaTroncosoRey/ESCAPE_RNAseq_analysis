This pipeline has been modified and extended from the HISAT2/StringTie protocol (Pertea et al., Nat. Prot., 2016), adding a pre-processing step using SortMeRNA (Kopylova E., No√© L. and Touzet H., Bioinformatics, 2012) and Trim Galore! (Felix Krueger, The Babraham Institute). To see the original pipeline visit ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/RNAseq_protocol.

In order to run the HISAT-StringTie pipeline on the example data, a Linux or OS X computer with at least 8 GB RAM
and preferably multiple cores should be used, following the steps suggested below.

 1. Download and install the current versions of 
     hisat2 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2) and 
     stringtie (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie).
    Install the Ballgown packages and its other dependencies in R as 
     described in the protocol paper. 
    The samtools program should also be installed on the system 
    (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), all versions from 0.1.19 to 1.3
    are supported for this script.
    Install SortMeRNA v 2.1b from. Create the indexes for the rRNA databases.
    Download and install TrimGalore! v.


 2. Create or choose a working directory for this run (input and output files
    will be stored in this directory).

 3. Download the test data (test_raw_data.gz), rnaseq_pipeline.sh and rnaseq_pipeline.config.sh
    in the current working directory. Then unpack test_raw.tar.gz:
 
      tar -zxvf test_data.tar.gz

    This command will create a directory ./rawdata in the current directory.

 4. Open rnaseq_pipeline.config.sh in a text editor in order to verify and 
    change the values of relevant variables as needed, particularly:
      * NUMCPUS should be set to the number of CPU threads to be used
        when running the various steps of the pipeline; normally this should
        never be set to a value higher than the available CPU cores on the
        machine.
      * RAW should be set to 1 if starting with the raw data or to 0 if the concatenated samples are already available in the samples/ directory.
      * HISAT2, STRINGTIE, SAMTOOLS, SORTMERNA, TRIMGALORE, RSCRIPT should be set to the full path to these
        programs on the system. By default the script is trying to find these
        automatically and it will succeed if the programs are in any of the
        PATH directories for the current shell.


 5. Execute the main script:
    
    ./rnaseq_pipeline_escape.sh out
    
    This will run the pipeline and create ./out, ./out/hisat2/, ./out/ballgown/, ./out/sortmerna and ./out/trimgalore/
    directories. The Ballgown object will be in ./out/ballgown/ directory.
    The log messages,  with timestamps for each  step, will be shown on the terminal
    and also saved in the  run.log file.
